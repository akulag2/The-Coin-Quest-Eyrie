Influences (Brief) 
 - <Influence #1> 
  Creeper from Minecraft 
          This game takes influence from the Creeper attack system 
          from Minecraft where at night Creeper comes near the 
          Player and blast their selves. That is where I got the idea 
          of making this kind of game.
   The elevator Pitch: 
            This is a fast-paced game with a story-driven focus where the player must 
            collect coins while avoiding enemies. If the player contacts any enemy, the 
            game ends.
   Project Description: 
           This game challenges players to collect scattered coins while avoiding 
           various traps. The game contains several levels in its campaign, each of 
           which is progressively more difficult. In normal mode, players just focus on 
           collecting coins at their own pace. However, in time mode, they have to 
           collect all the coins in a limited time, which adds urgency and excitement to 
           the game. In normal or time mode, players must show their skills, navigate 
           obstacles and strategize to successfully collect coins and progress through 
           increasingly difficult levels.
   Core Gameplay Mechanics - Coin Collection and Enemies
      - Coin Collections 
           The objective for the player is to gather as many coins as 
          they can, with these coins randomly dispersed across the 
          map.
    - Enemies 
          Enemies are the thing that makes this game more 
          thrilling. Players need to ensure their safety from these 
          foes as they relentlessly pursue the player throughout the 
          level, with new enemies arriving to eliminate the player.
     - Game Mode 
            the game has 2 types of gameplay modes: 
            1. Time Base 
            2. Without Time Base 
                 In time-based games, players must collect all the coins within a 
                 set time limit, and if they can't gather them all in time, they 
                 lose the game. 
                 In the time-free mode, players must collect coins carefully, as 
                 certain non-player characters (NPCs) move randomly and 
                 attempt to eliminate the player.
