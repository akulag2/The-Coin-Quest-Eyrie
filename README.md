Creeper from Minecraft
This game takes influence from the Creeper attack system from Minecraft where at night Creeper comes near the Player and blast their selves. That is where I got the idea of making this kind of game.
 
The elevator Pitch:
This is a fast-paced game with a story-driven focus where the player must collect coins while avoiding enemies. If the player contacts any enemy, the game ends.


Project Description:
This game challenges players to collect scattered coins while avoiding various traps. The game contains several levels in its campaign, each of which is progressively more difficult. In normal mode, players just focus on collecting coins at their own pace. However, in time mode, they have to collect all the coins in a limited time, which adds urgency and excitement to the game. In normal or time mode, players must show their skills, navigate obstacles and strategize to successfully collect coins and progress through increasingly difficult levels.
Core Gameplay Mechanics
-	Coin Collection and Enemies
-	Coin Collections
The objective for the player is to gather as many coins as they can, with these coins randomly dispersed across the map.

-	Enemies
Enemies are the thing that makes this game more thrilling. Players need to ensure their safety from these foes as they relentlessly pursue the player throughout the level, with new enemies arriving to eliminate the player.
-	Game Mode
the game has 2 types of gameplay modes:
1.	Time Base
2.	Without Time Base

In time-based games, players must collect all the coins within a set time limit, and if they can't gather them all in time, they lose the game.
 
In the time-free mode, players must collect coins carefully, as certain non-player characters (NPCs) move randomly and attempt to eliminate the player.

Story and Gameplay
Story
Once, there was a boy named James who really liked collecting coins. He spent a lot of time searching for new coins to add to his collection.
One day, while he was exploring an old attic, he found a chest full of very old coins. These coins were different from any he had seen before. While he was looking at them, one of the coins started to glow. It floated in the air and then disappeared.
James was confused and looked around for the coin but couldn't find it. Then, he heard a voice. The voice told him not to worry and said that it had taken the coin to another world.
James asked who was talking, and the voice said it was the "Coin Spirit," the guardian of all coins. The Coin Spirit chose James to be its champion because he loved coins for their history and beauty, not just their value.
James was honoured and asked what he needed to do. The Coin Spirit told him to collect all the ancient coins scattered across different worlds to restore balance to the universe.
James agreed to the challenge and started his adventure. He went to many different worlds with unique challenges. He faced dangerous creatures, solved puzzles, and even battled other coin collectors. But he never gave up and was determined to collect all the ancient coins to bring balance back to the universe.
After many months of searching, James collected the last of the ancient coins and returned to his world. He gave the coins to the Coin Spirit, who was pleased and called him a true coin collector and a worthy champion.
As a reward, the Coin Spirit granted James one wish. He wished for a world where all coin collectors could come together and share their love for coins.
So, the Coin Spirit created a new world called "Eyrie". It was a place where coin collectors from all over the universe could trade coins, learn about coin history, and share their stories.
 
James was happy because he finally found a place where he belonged, and he knew he would never stop collecting coins.
